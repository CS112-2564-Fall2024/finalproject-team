Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game was inspired by a YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO4KUCtbmq8&t=249s) and includes custom enhancements such as clear win-check logic, reset functionality, and a structure based on object-oriented programming principles. This project demonstrates concepts like concrete classes, abstract classes, and custom exceptionsâ€”a very simple, but interactive gaming experience.

-  Tic-Tac-Toe game with a 3x3 grid.
- Support for player turns and win/tie detection.
- A "Restart" button to reset the game.
- Includes an abstract class (`Game`), a concrete class (`TicTacToeGame`), and a custom exception (`InvalidMoveException`). I used the classes HelloAplication and HelloController (both abstract).
